# About Me üëã

Hi, I'm James, welcome to my little slice of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet).

First and foremost I'm a proud husband to Kirsten, and father of 2 adorable children, Hamish and Elodie. They are my everything ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm a technology enthusiast at heart with a passion for all things **Web**.

My love affair began in the mid-90's as a teenager fiddling with [Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) in the computer lab of the local university.

Once I saw that you could [View Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20000201105429/http://www.shirky.com/writings/view_source.html) and reverse engineer the webpages of the time, remixing my own versions in Windows Notepad, it was game over, I knew that I had found my _thing_.

I've been meaning to setup a [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) since the late 90's but as a teenager, and into my 20's I was full of self doubt, overly concerned with the perception of others. Putting _my_ thoughts out into the ether? Who cares what I have to say?

Mistakes were made. Oh how I wish I'd been doing 'this' for decades.

Anyway, this is **for me**, but if you get some value out of my ramblings along the way, great!

So here we are, [Better Late Than Never](/).

Cheers, _James Deane_
